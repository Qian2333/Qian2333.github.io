About Me
=====
I'm Yudong Wang, in Chinese 王昱栋, a Ph.D. student at Peking University. I'm supervised by Prof. Zhifang Sui. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from School of Mathematical Sciences and Yingcai Honors College of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, supervised by Prof. [Liang-Jian Deng](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/).

My research interests primarily revolve around language models and machine learning, focusing on the following three key aspects:

* Exploring the interpretability and internal representations of all AI models. 

* Data selection, particularly data mixing and data sampling strategies. 

* Reinforcement learning.
